                <p>I have worked with a quite few <u><strong>page builders</strong></u> like WPBakery Page Builder, Visual Composer, Elementor, Beaver Builder, SiteOrigin, Revolution Slider and many more. But the ones I use are Divi, Gutenberg and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields).</p>
                <h2>Divi Builder</h2>
                <p>Divi is a builder developed by Elegant Themes. It is the most advanced page builder I have had the pleasure to use. It has so many options that some people are overwhelmed by this, but I like it. It comes with a vast and growing selection of page templates, powerful Drag-and-Drop Content Editor, split testing tool, and some other useful WordPress plugins to download. Some of my favourite features are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to change default styles for the modules.</li>
                    <li>History option that allows to undo and redo your actions.</li>
                    <li>Powerful theme builder that you can build templates for different content types. You can target pages, posts, custom post types and taxonomies.</li>
                    <li>Module and layout and library and portability feature that can save you a ton of time.</li>
                    <li>… and many more</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote><em>Divi also has a great community where people will help you in no time with your issues. My favourite is Divi Web Designers Facebook group.</em><cite><em>~ Patrick Hladun</em></cite></blockquote>
                <p>The pricing is attractive. They sell it for $89/year or $249 one-time. The lifetime access plan worried me a bit, but Elegant Themes is on the market for many years, so I think it is a good investment.</p>
                <h2>Gutenberg</h2>
                <p>Gutenberg is a new page editor that comes with WordPress. For the content like blog posts or other custom post types where Divi or another page builder would be an overkill. I create custom blocks that my clients can use to create elegant blog posts. Also, both Gutenberg and Divi use React JS for front-end.</p>
                <h2>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</h2>
                <p>ACF is not a page builder, but rather a plugin that allows you to add additional options to pages, posts or any other post types and taxonomies or even create your custom theme options page. Also, ACF has a great feature that is called Flexible Content. You can use it to build page templates with cleaner code and still give your clients ways to update their content easily. You can also use ACF as a powerful PHP-based framework for developing custom block types for Gutenberg.</p>
                <p>Yep, so these are my favourite tools for building pages in WordPress. All I’ll ever need.</p>
